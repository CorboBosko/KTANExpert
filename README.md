# Module Instructions
## Morse-Code
Enter the morse code as it is flashed to you in the module. 
Use period( . ) and minus( - ) with a space between letters to input the morse (represented by a longer space in the flasing module.)
When the module stop flashing the longest and then starts again, it means the word is restarting. 
The program does NOT require that you start at the beginning of the word, only that you don't duplicate any letters already input.
Once you have the morse word input (with no duplication), press ENTER, and input the frequency provided.

### Example:
1. KTANE flashes: .. -.-. -.-   - .-. .. -.-. -.-   - .-. .. -.-. -.-   - .-. .. -.-. -.-   etc.
2. You input: **.. -.-. -.- - .-.** into the program and press ENTER
3. The Programs gives you: **Word was: Trick    Input 3.532 MHz**
4. You set the frequency to 3.532 MHz in KTANE. *Module Complete, move on to the next on.*
