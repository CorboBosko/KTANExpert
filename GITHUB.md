# How to use GitHub the right way
## (On this repo)

Main is the code that functions properly. When a module is completed and fully working, it is merged with main
# To Create a New Module
1. Create a Draft PR for that Module that uses the **module-addition** branch
2. When working on that module, commit the change to **module-addition**
3. Once the module is finished, go over the commits in the PR
4. If looking good, merge with **main**
5. Do approiate things in the Manual Project
6. Create the next module's Draft PR.

# How to edit an existing module
1. Any changes to existing modules go to the **module-changes** group
2. Once a change has been made, commit the change to **module-changes**
3. At some point, create a PR of **module-changes** *(Maybe use a version number, IDK)*
4. Verify, and merge with Main. 

# How to edit non-module stuff
1. Commit any changes to **random**
2. PR, merge w/ **main**, it doesn't really matter yet.
